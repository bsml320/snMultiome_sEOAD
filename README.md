# Description
Sporadic early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (sEOAD) represents a significant but less-studied subtype of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Here, we generated a single-nucleus multiome atlas derived from the postmortem prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus of individuals with or without sEOAD.
